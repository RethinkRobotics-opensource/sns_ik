The Saturation in the Null-Space (SNS) Inverse-Kinematics (IK) Library
implements a collection of algorithms written by Fabrizio Flacco for
inverting the differential kinematics of a robot.

## What problems are solved by this library?

The SNS-IK library is a library that is designed to compute fast solutions to
inverse-kinematics problems on redundant kinematic chains.
It is particularly good at handling multiple prioritized task objectives
while satisfying joint position and velocity limits.

The core solvers in this library operate at the velocity-level, although we
also include a position-level solver.

## Algorithm Overview:

**SNS Velocity IK:** This is the core algorithm developed by Fabrizio.
All of the other algorithms in this library are improvements upon this one.

**Optimal SNS:** Add an objective function to the standard SNS velocity IK solver,
allowing it to compute a solution that is both feasible and optimal.

**Optimal SNS with Margin:** Improvement upon the Optimal SNS solver to make it
better at avoiding discontinuous velocities over a sequence of IK calls.

**Fast SNS IK:** Several numerical improvements to reduce the total CPU time
required for the SNS Velocity IK solver.

**Fast Optimal SNS:** Similar to the Optimal SNS, but with several numerical improvements.
